# Faculty of Information and Communication Technology <br/> ITCS257 Frontend Application Development <br/> CSS Framework – Tailwind

## Objectives

* Students will understand the utility-first CSS approach and practice using Tailwind classes to build layouts and components.
* Students will use the CSS Framework Tailwind CSS to design and style web pages.


## Instruction

You are tasked with designing a simple Invoice Management System UI using Tailwind CSS.

1. Download all project files, including the HTML file and the assets folder. The starter HTML provides the basic structure of the page, but no stylesheets are included. **You are free to design your own pages from scratch if you prefer not to use the provided template.**

2. Set Up Tailwind (CDN Method) for each page by adding the following in the `<head>` tag of all HTML files:

   ```
   <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
   ```
   
3. Use any Tailwind CSS utility classes to style your pages freely. However, your design must include the following key components:
   * Navigation bar that reflects the page flow, i.e., Login --> Homepage (index) --> Invoice Management --> Create an Invoice
   * For the **Invoice Management** page, it should include either a clean data table or cards displaying invoice information.
   * For the **Create Invoice** page, the form should receive the following parameters: client ID, quotation number, issue date, due date, status (Paid or Unpaid), subtotal, tax amount, and total amount.

## Submission

1. **Include a Generative AI usage declaration and reflection** at the beginning of your file. Clearly state whether AI tools were used and provide a brief reflection on your work.
2. **Push your code** to the GitHub Classroom repository for this assignment. Ensure that all files are properly committed and pushed **before the submission deadline**.
3. **Submit the lab by the end of the next class session to LAs**. Late submissions may not be accepted.

## AI Usage Declaration and Reflection

Students must add an AI Declaration and Reflection of Today's Learning to the top of their file. 

A reflection is not a summary of what you did or what the AI generated.
Instead, it is a personal explanation of your learning process. 
- If you used AI, focus on how AI impacted your learning or understanding of the code.
- If you did not use AI, focus on your learning, tools, and experience from the lab.

Here are examples:

### Example 1 – No AI Used
```
<!--
AI Declaration:
No Generative AI tools were used for this lab.  
All code was written manually by the student.

Reflection:
[ Your Reflection goes here
Today’s lab helped me learn [key takeaway].  
I practiced ...
]
-->
```

### Example 2 – AI Used for Reference
```
<!--
AI Declaration:
I used ChatGPT only to clarify HTML semantic tags.  
No code was directly copied without modification.

Reflection:
[ Write 1–2 sentences reflecting on your learning or how AI impacted your understanding]
-->
```

### Example 3 – AI Assisted in Debugging
```
<!--
AI Declaration:
I used ChatGPT to help debug the CSS in my invoice layout.  
I wrote all the other code, and I understand the entire implementation.

Reflection:
[ Write 1–2 sentences reflecting on your learning or how AI impacted your understanding ]
-->
```
